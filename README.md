1.requirements

- pytorch ==1.10.0


- To run the code, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX3080 GPU video card with 10 GB video memory is required. 


- Software development environment should be any Python integrated development environment used on an NVIDIA video card. Programming language: Python 3.7.

2.How to useï¼Ÿ

- Use `utils/create_training_images.py` to create the subvolume training images. This will create the sub-volume training images as an hdf5 format which can then be used for training.  

- Train the GAN,use `main_train.py` to train the GAN network.
